# Full Stack Full CRUD To-Do List

An application to make some tasks for doing later.

## Description

### Base Mode

  I wanted to make a simple application to record a task and a note for said task.  When you create a task you will see task, your notes, and date created for the task made.  
  
  The big problem I had was adding a class to the div I was chosing, and basing the logic around if/else but was being unsuccessful so I ended up hard coding into if/else appending logic.
